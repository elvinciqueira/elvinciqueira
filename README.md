My name is Elvin Ciqueira, and I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2019. Actually I work as a Front End Engineer at [Ferreri](https://ferreri.co/). I'm passionate about learning and discovering new stuff.

In my free time I like to read books (ðŸ“š), to listen to music (ðŸŽµ) and eventually I like to philosophize about life.

Would you like to find me?
